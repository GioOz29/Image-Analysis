This folder contains the project for Image analysis with microcontrollers course at DTU. The project involves the use of filtering and ellipses recognition to detect the Docking Port of the ISS.
The math behing the recognition also gives the camera position information, therefore, with those deta I was able to understand the position of the ship respect to the Docking Port.
